# VimCuteBracketsAndQuotes

By using this, you can make your Vim as cute as IDE when you input brackets and quotes.

Main Funtions:

1. When you input a ( or [ at the end of a line, a ) or ] will be input automatically;

2. When you input a { and then input Enter, a } will be input automatically and an empty line will be prepared with good indent;

3. If the character next to cursor is a right bracket, you can input the bracket character to SKIP it;

4. When you input a ' or " at the end of a line, a ' or " will be inpit automatically;

5. If the character next to cursor is a quote, you can input the quote character to SKIP it.;

***

Installation:

Copy all lines in vimCuteBracketsAndQuotes.txt to you .vimrc. 
(You need to change the code a little if you *set filetype indent on* instead of *set autoindent*.)
That's all!
