# VimCuteBracketsAndQuotes

This is NOT a plugin! You only need to copy some code to you .vimrc file! That's all!

By using this, you can make your Vim as cute as IDE when you type brackets and quotes.

Main Funtions:

1. When you type a ( or [ at the end of a line, a ) or ] will be typed automatically;

2. When you typed a { and then typed Enter, a } will be typed automatically and an empty line will be prepared with good indent;

3. If the character next to cursor is a right bracket, you can typed the bracket character to SKIP it;

4. When you typed a ' or " at the end of a line, a ' or " will be inpit automatically;

5. If the character next to cursor is a quote, you can typed the quote character to SKIP it.;

Installation:

Copy all lines in vimCuteBracketsAndQuotes.txt to you .vimrc. 

(You need to change the code a little if you *set filetype indent on* instead of *set autoindent*.)

Yes! That's all!
